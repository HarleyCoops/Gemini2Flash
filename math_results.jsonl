Two of the\\nnumbers add together to make a total of 8, therefore two of the\\nnumbers could be four or six.\\nA number can only have a single pair of digits. That is, when you\\ngive up one digit to make it the last one, there will still be two\\nnumber. For example, nine is a multiple of two because if you\\ntake out the first digit from nine (that's two), then what remains\\nwill always add up to nine again.\\nSo your answer would be:\\nEight + Four = Ten\\nOne more question:\\nHow do I find the other number when given one number and another sum? The formula for this problem is simple:\\na/b + c/d = x where x represents the unknown\\nThe first step in solving this is subtracting b from both sides so we can have the fraction on one side with all the values. We do this by adding c to both sides, which leaves us with:\\na/c + d/x = x + c\\nThen we take away each term on its own as well as multiplying everything by the denominator and multiply them back through. You end up getting:\\nx^2 (a/d) = (x^2 c - d^2)/c (this means dividing the numerator into the same denominator as x)\\nThe remaining part on the right side is just our final answer, x.\\nNow to put all together, let's say we have:\\n10 = (8/12) + 2 (or any number between two of those)\\n10= (2+6+4) / 12+2+2+4 = 12+4=16/18\\nYou may notice that the fractions don't cancel, but this makes the equation easier.\\nIf you wanted to know the exact number that would be 16/21.\\nHope this helps!

So, let's start with the problem: how many time 6 goes into 2? If there were zero remainder and if you had a calculator, the answer would be 0.\\nBut, since we don't have a calculator to use right away, we need some more work on our side. Since we have two digits here and are looking for how many digits we have left to multiply in order to get 2 (our divisor), we must divide 2 by the largest digit we know so far, which is 2 itself:\\nWhen divided by 2 it equals 1.\\nThe answer is therefore 3 times 6 = 18\\nStill stuck?

That way we should see what they are all equal.\\nFor this one we could break out both sides and look at their difference. They're actually the same thing.\\nThat means that the second term is just a multiple of the first term, meaning it will give us a whole bunch of zeros. This makes sense because if a is greater than or equal to b and c are also above a, then ac > bc\\nSo the rest is easy.\\na^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)\\na^3-b^3=(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)\\na^4-b^4=(a-b)^2(ab+b^2)\\nb^3+c^3=(b-c)(b^2+bc+c^2)\\nb^4+c^4=b^4+(c^2-ab)^2=c^4+ac^2-ab^2-2ab^2\\nNow, I can plug these back into the original expression.\\na^3-a-b^3+ca^2+ab+b^2-2ab-2c^2\\na(c^2-ab)+b(b^2+ab+c^2)-2c^2\\nNow, I can plug in values to make the terms easier to handle. a=3, b=-1, c=-2\\n3((-2)^2(-1))-(2)^2(-3)^2\\n3(4)(1)-(4)(9)\\n12-36\\nStill stuck?
